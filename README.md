### <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
We're really excited to be running a one-day bootcamp in Node.js for women in London on Saturday 7th November 2015. It's aimed at all female-identified people who already have a grounding in JavaScript. Need more information? Have a look [here](https://github.com/node-girls/start-here/blob/master/README.md).

There will be several mentors on the day so don't worry if you feel left behind; please ask questions and we'll get you up to speed!

### <a name="prerequisites"></a>Pre-requisites
Please bring your computer, and please make sure you have Node installed! You can follow instructions on how to do that on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

If you have a Linux computer, you might find [this blog post](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux) useful for your installation.

### <a name="further-resources"></a>Further Resources
We can't teach you the whole of Node in a day but hopefully we've piqued your interest and you want to learn more, but where do you start?

+ The [Node chapter of Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html) gives some more background and challenges.
+ [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) is an ever-popular introduction to Node.
+ [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) (the authors of learnyounode) have a lot of open source workshops and even run events globally.

There are also loads of great meetups in London aimed at encouraging people (and especially minorities) into the coding world (not necessarily JavaScript or Node):

+ [Ladies Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/) is a regular meetup aimed at all ladies who code (in any language) with talks and workshops.
+ [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/) is a JavaScript-based bootcamp in East London. It lasts 16 weeks and takes you to being a full stack JavaScript and Node.js developer. Join the weekly [Coding for Everyone](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/events/225670269/) on Mondays, and the fortnightly [Coding for Women](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/events/225569882/) on Tuesdays.
+ [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) has online tutorials and weekly meetups where you can sign up to have a coach for the whole evening.
+ [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-London/) is another meetup directed towards women in coding (again, any language).
+ [LNUG](http://lnug.org/) is the London Node User Group that takes place on the 4th Wednesday of every month with talks all about Node.
+ [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) is building a huge community of all things coding.
