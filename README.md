# Node Girls

### <a name="further-resources"></a>Further Resources
We can't teach you the whole of JavaScript or Node in a day but hopefully we've piqued your interest and you want to learn more, but where do you start?

There are also loads of great meetups in London aimed at encouraging people (and especially minorities) into the coding world (not necessarily JavaScript or Node):

+ Join us on Slack! If you've attended a workshop in person, you should have been invited to join our Slack channel, where you can keep us all up to date on your journey. Let us know what you're working on, and any events you're going to!
+ [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/) is a JavaScript-based bootcamp in London. It lasts 16 weeks and takes you to being a full stack JavaScript and Node.js developer. Join the [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/): the weekly Coding for Everyone on Mondays, and the fortnightly Coding for Women on Tuesdays.
+ [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) has online tutorials and weekly meetups where you can sign up to have a coach for the whole evening. You'll see lots of Node Girls at these meetups!
+ [JS Monthly](https://www.meetup.com/js-monthly/) is a monthly meetup that helps you keep up to date with everything JavaScript-related.
+ [LNUG](http://lnug.org/) is the London Node User Group that takes place on the 4th Wednesday of every month with talks all about Node.

### JavaScript resources
+ We love [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for getting you up to speed with web development so you'll also learn HTML and CSS along with your JavaScript! At the end you'll be able to work on projects for nonprofits!

### Node resources
+ The [Node chapter of Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html) gives some more background and challenges.
+ [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) is an ever-popular introduction to Node.
+ [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) (the authors of learnyounode) have a lot of open source workshops and even run events globally.
